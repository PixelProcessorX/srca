2016-02-13T20:16:07, 0, Warning, Failed to set up SSL because of the following SSL library error:
 SSL context is not usable without certificate and private key




Fri Mar 18 22:18:27 CDT 2016 WARN: Establishing SSL connection without server's identity verification
is not recommended. According to MySQL 5.5.45+, 5.6.26+ and 5.7.6+ requirements SSL connection must
be established by default if explicit option isn't set. For compliance with existing applications
not using SSL the verifyServerCertificate property is set to 'false'. You need either to explicitly
disable SSL by setting useSSL=false, or set useSSL=true and provide truststore for server certificate verification.
